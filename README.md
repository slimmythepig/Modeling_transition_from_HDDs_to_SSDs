## Description
This project analyzes worldwide shipments of Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD) using time-series and innovation-diffusion models. Our analysis fits classic and generalized Bass models, the Guseo–Guidolin model, a dynamic regression with ARIMA errors, an unbalanced competition & regime-change model (UCRCD), and standalone ARIMA baselines.
